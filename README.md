#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is designing, building and maintaining software solutions that solve real world problems. Software engineering principles ensure that applications are well-structured, tested, and optimized, reducing bugs and system failures.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Birth of Software Engineering - The term "software engineering" was formally introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the software crisis—where growing software complexity led to unreliable and costly projects. 
Rise of Object Oriented Programming- The adoption of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolutionized software development by organizing code into reusable objects, making it more modular and maintainable.
Agile Manifesto- The publication of the Agile Manifesto introduced Agile methodologies, shifting focus from rigid, document-heavy processes to iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Idea Generation- The initial phase where the concept for the software is identified based on market needs, business goals, or customer feedback.
2. Requirement Analysis- Gathering and defining functional and non-functional requirements by communicating with stakeholders to ensure clarity on what the software should achieve.
3. Product Design- Creating blueprints, wireframes, and architectural designs that define the software’s structure, user interface, and system workflows.
4. Product Development- Writing and compiling code based on the design specifications, ensuring the functionality aligns with the requirements.
5. Integration and Testing- Combining different modules and conducting rigorous testing (unit, system, integration, and user acceptance testing) to identify and fix defects.
6. Deployment-  Releasing the software for end-users, either as a full rollout or in phases, while monitoring performance and potential issues.
7. Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to ensure the software remains functional and efficient over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile methodology places emphasis on flexible, iterative progress by breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable units of work while  waterfall model is a rigid, highly structured approach that requires the execution of the project to be defined before any work can begin. An online education platform can use Agile to update course content based on student feedback and performance metrics regularly.Example waterfall methodology is building a new office complex which requires careful planning and sequential execution. The project manager first gathers all the requirements, such as building specifications, timelines, and budgets. Then, architects and engineers create detailed designs. After approval, construction starts and strict quality controls follow. Finally, the building is handed over to the client for use and maintenance.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer- design, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools. They also help build software systems that power networks and devices and ensure that those systems remain functional.
Quality Assurance Engineer- are responsible for ensuring a product is meeting quality requirements before its launch by monitoring every stage of the product development process and suggesting corrections that range from basic product necessities to feature improvements and optimizations.
Project Manager- Responsible for planning, executing and overseeing a project to meets its goals. They lead a team, manage resources, and ensure projects are completed on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integration Development Environments - provide a feature-rich environment that boosts developers' productivity, with code auto-completion, intelligent suggestions, and code snippets, programmers can write code faster and with fewer errors. It is designed to help developers write, compile, and debug their code more efficiently. Example of IDE is Apache Netneans.
Version Control Systems- are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code. Facilitates coordination, sharing, and collaboration across the entire software development team. Example of (VCS) is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

The rapid pace of technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.Successful engineers stand out by adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.
Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.Strict time constraints can impact a development team's efficiency, potentially resulting in lower-quality outcomes. To address these challenges, effective time management strategies are essential. Many teams adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing - They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. Importance is that allows developers to identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle by testing the smallest functional units of code.
Integration Testing - Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. Importance is that it ensures that different components of a software application interact correctly with each other, identifying potential issues early in the development process, improving overall system reliability.
System Testing - Process in which a quality assurance  team evaluates how the various components of an application interact together in the full, integrated system or application. Importance is that a comprehensive system testing process ultimately boosts the product quality
Acceptance Testing- Are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. Importance is that  it serves as the final quality check before a product is released to the market, ensuring that it meets all functional and non-functional requirements, user expectations, and business needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of writing instructions to get the best results from an AI model. It's importance is that helps AI models understand and respond to a wider range of queries.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - Write a report on event planning
Clear Prompt - Write a 2-page report outlining the key steps in planning a corporate showcasing event. Include sections on budgeting, vendor coordination, marketing strategies, and stakeholder engagement. Provide real-world examples where possible.
The improved (clear) prompt is more effective because it provides specificity, structure, and expectations, which guide the response in a focused and relevant direction.
